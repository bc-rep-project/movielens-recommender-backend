# Next Steps for GitHub-based Deployment

We've set up continuous deployment for the MovieLens Recommender API. Here's a summary of what's been done and what you need to do next:

## What We've Set Up

1. **Dockerfile**: A proper Docker configuration for building the FastAPI application container.

2. **GitHub Actions Workflow**: A CI/CD pipeline in `.github/workflows/cloud-run-deploy.yml` that automatically builds and deploys the application to Google Cloud Run whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.

3. **Documentation**:
   - README.md: General information about the project and how to set up GitHub secrets.
   - DEPLOYMENT.md: Detailed step-by-step guide for setting up GCP and GitHub for deployment.

## Next Steps

1. **Push These Changes to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Set up continuous deployment with GitHub Actions"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Set Up GitHub Secrets**
   Follow the instructions in README.md to set up the required secrets:
   - GCP_PROJECT_ID
   - GCP_SA_KEY

3. **Create and Configure GCP Resources**
   Follow the steps in DEPLOYMENT.md to:
   - Set up a GCP project (if you don't have one)
   - Enable required APIs
   - Create a service account
   - Generate and download a service account key

4. **Monitor the First Deployment**
   - After pushing to GitHub, go to the Actions tab to watch the workflow run
   - Check for any errors and fix them if necessary

5. **Verify the Deployment**
   - Once the workflow completes successfully, access the Cloud Run URL
   - Verify that the API is responding correctly

6. **Make Additional Changes**
   - Any future changes pushed to the main branch will trigger automatic deployments
   - You can also manually trigger deployments from the GitHub Actions interface

## Maintaining and Improving the Pipeline

- **Environment Variables**: Consider storing environment variables in GitHub secrets for sensitive values.
  
- **Additional CI Steps**: You might want to add testing, linting, and security scanning steps to the CI process.

- **Multiple Environments**: Consider setting up multiple environments (dev, staging, prod) with different branches triggering deployments to different environments.

- **Monitoring and Alerting**: Set up monitoring for your Cloud Run service to track performance, errors, and resource usage.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If you encounter issues with the deployment:

1. **Check GitHub Actions Logs**: Detailed logs are available in the Actions tab.

2. **Check Cloud Run Logs**: The service logs in Cloud Run can help identify runtime issues.

3. **Service Account Permissions**: Ensure the service account has all required permissions.

4. **Docker Build Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are correctly specified in requirements.txt.

5. **Regional Availability**: Make sure the region specified in the workflow is available for Cloud Run in your project.
