# Potentially database-specific models (if different from API models)
# backend/app/data_access/models.py

# This file can contain Pydantic models or dataclasses specifically representing
# the database schema structure, ONLY IF it differs significantly from the
# API request/response models defined in `app/models/`.

# For example, if using an ORM like SQLAlchemy, your ORM models might go here
# or in a dedicated `app/db/models.py`.

# In this project's context, where `app/models/` Pydantic models are used
# directly with Motor (potentially using field aliases like `alias='_id'`),
# this file is likely NOT REQUIRED.

# Example placeholder if needed later:
# from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
# from bson import ObjectId
#
# class MovieDocument(BaseModel):
#     # Example if you didn't use aliases in app/models/
#     id: ObjectId = Field(..., alias="_id")
#     title: str
#     # ... other fields matching DB exactly
#
#     class Config:
#         arbitrary_types_allowed = True # Allow ObjectId
#         populate_by_name = True

pass # Keep empty if not needed
